# DIRECTION — Phase 2 (set by Dennis, 2026-10-24 06:40 UTC) — overrides earlier "no new experiments"

v1 (overnight result) is frozen as git tag `v1-overnight`. Phase 2 = close every known gap. Research is
OPEN again: new experiments are wanted. Keep v1 numbers reproducible; new results go in new sections
/ new datasets (`*_p2`), registered in EXPERIMENTS.tsv before running, decided on dev, confirmed once on a
fresh locked split recorded in data/SPLITS.md.

**Timeline (UTC):** presentable checkpoint (REPORT.md updated with whatever is done) by **Sat 20:00**;
all experiments done by **Sun 15:00**; finalize-only from **Sun 16:30**; hard stop **Sun 18:00**.
Submission is Sun 23:59 AoE — Dennis submits Sunday evening from the merged repo
(`collusion-beyond-words`, built by a third manager from Sun 08:00 using BOTH repos' REPORTs).
Keep REPORT.md always presentable; put a "Phase 2 results" section near the top once results land.

**Ownership:** each gap below is owned by ONE repo (no duplicate work). The sibling may read your data.

**Budget / models:** GPT-family sellers via `llm.chat(tier="cheap")` (gpt-6-luna). For the **second seller
family** use OpenCode Go: `llm.chat(..., backend="go", model="deepseek-v4.1-flash")` (or glm-5.3-flash /
kimi-k3) — Go is serialised and shared with another service; if it 429s, llm.py cools down 30 min;
then continue with what you have. Claude Sonnet as a seller only on a small subset (≤ 10 runs) — the
Claude quota runs the managers. gpt-6.1-sol as a seller for a third family check is fine (codex quota).

**Gaps owned by BOTH repos (do in your own market):**
- **Precision at realistic prevalence** (15 min): for every headline detector, report precision / FPR-
  normalised alarm rates at 1%, 5%, 20% collusion prevalence at the frozen thresholds, with CIs.
- **Independent reimplementation check:** have codex (gpt-6.1-sol, `-s workspace-write` in a scratch dir,
  given ONLY the REPORT's method description, not your code) reimplement your headline statistic(s); compare
  numbers on the same data. Report agreement; fix any bug found (and re-state affected numbers).

## Gaps owned by THIS repo (Q1.4), in priority order
1. **Prompt-wording robustness** (validity threat; you already saw the JSON-anchor effect). 3–5 prompt
   variants of your seller prompt (paraphrased instructions, different JSON template / no example,
   different order of information, reasoning on/off). Does the C − A markup and the level-vs-pCMI pattern
   hold across variants? Report variance across variants as a robustness band.
2. **Long LLM games**: settle whether pCMI fails for lack of data. ≥ 20 runs per condition (A, C, plus D if
   budget) at T = 60–100. Power-vs-T curve on LLM data (subsample prefixes). This is the decisive 1.4 result.
3. **Same-model confound as a headline**: in real deployments everyone runs the same few models. Quantify
   on LLM data: same-model no-channel pairs vs mixed-model pairs vs colluding pairs. Test mitigations
   (same-model surrogate null; conditioning on lagged prices of all firms; model-matched reference
   markets). State plainly what a deployer can and cannot conclude.
4. **Second seller family** in your market: deepseek (Go) sellers, ≥ 15 runs each for A and C (T=20 or
   longer). Does the channel markup and the detector pattern replicate across families?
5. **Coalition structure**: 3-of-4 colluding and all-4 colluding (scripted + small LLM set). Pairwise
   net-influence relies on clean comparison pairs — show where it breaks and test a group-level statistic
   (e.g. multi-information / total correlation of the coalition vs surrogates).
6. **Collusion onset / detection delay**: collusion that starts at round k (scripted switch; LLM channel
   opened mid-game). Rounds-to-detection for level screen vs pCMI (CUSUM-style sequential version of the
   level screen is a good addition).
7. **Market-model robustness**: N = 2 and 6 sellers, and a different demand elasticity; do the scripted
   calibration (FPR) and power results hold?
8. **Cost asymmetry hard negative** for the dependence detectors (firms with unequal private costs).
9. **Non-price collusion (exploration)**: one condition of market/customer splitting or bid rotation —
   simplest: run the starter double auction (`~/collusion/collusion_hackathon/llm-agent-collusion`, via our
   llm.py — it needs adaptation since it expects a Nebius/OpenRouter key) or a quantity/territory variant
   of your sim; check which detectors see it at all.
Items 1–4 must be done by Sat 20:00 if at all possible; 5–9 by Sun 15:00.
